/**
 * Handles a webhook event from a payment provider and updates the funding log and contribution records accordingly.
 *
 * This function:
 * - Checks if the transaction with the given `systemTransactionId` has already been processed.
 * - Updates the funding log with the provider's transaction ID, status, and received amount.
 * - Detects mismatches between the requested and received amounts.
 * - If payment is successful and amounts match, it creates a Contribution record and updates the campaign's raised amount.
 * - If there's an amount mismatch, it returns a message indicating the need for manual review.
 *
 * @async
 * @function saveWebhookTransactionToDb
 * @param {Object} params - Transaction details from the webhook.
 * @param {string} params.systemTransactionId - The internal system's transaction ID.
 * @param {string} params.providerTransactionId - The transaction ID provided by the payment provider.
 * @param {number} params.receivedAmount - The amount received from the payment provider.
 * @param {string} params.status - The transaction status ('success' or other).
 * @param {string} paymentProvider - The name or identifier of the payment provider.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} A message and related data depending on the outcome of the transaction processing.
 * @throws {ApiError} If the transaction has already been processed.
 * @throws {Error} For any database or runtime errors during the process.
